You prolly think that you are better now better now 
You only say that cause Im not around not around 
You know I never meant to let you down let you down 
Woulda gave you anything woulda gave you everything 
You know I say that I am better now better now 
I only say that cause youre not around not around 
You know I never meant to let you down let you down 
Woulda gave you anything woulda gave you everything 
Ohoh 

I did not believe that it would end no 
Everything came second to the Benzo 
Youre not even speaking to my friends no 
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though 
Twenty candles blow em out and open your eyes 
We were looking forward to the rest of our lives 
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside 
Now its in your dresser with the socks you dont like 
And Im rollin rollin rollin rollin 
With my brothers like its Jonas Jonas 
Drinkin Henny and Im tryna forget 
But I cant get this shit outta my head 

You prolly think that you are better now better now 
You only say that cause Im not around not around 
You know I never meant to let you down let you down 
Woulda gave you anything woulda gave you everything 
You know I say that I am better now better now 
I only say that cause youre not around not around 
You know I never meant to let you down let you down 
Woulda gave you anything woulda gave you everything 
Ohoh 

I seen you with your other dude 
He seemed like he was pretty cool 
I was so broken over you 
Life it goes on what can you do 
I just wonder what its gonna take 
Another foreign or a bigger chain 
Because no matter how my life has changed 
I keep on looking back on better days 

You prolly think that you are better now better now 
You only say that cause Im not around not around 
You know I never meant to let you down let you down 
Woulda gave you anything woulda gave you everything 
You know I say that I am better now better now 
I only say that cause youre not around not around 
You know I never meant to let you down let you down 
Woulda gave you anything woulda gave you everything 
Ohoh 

I promise 
I swear to you Ill be okay 
Youre only the love of my life 

You prolly think that you are better now better now 
You only say that cause Im not around not around 
You know I never meant to let you down let you down 
Woulda gave you anything woulda gave you everything
